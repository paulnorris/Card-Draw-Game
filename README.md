# Card-Draw-Game
Draw Cards Until A Spade Project


This game shows the likelyhood of drawing a number of cards before drawing a spade.  

It is drawn from an unlimited deck (not a standard deck) so that each probability of the next draw is a static variable.

The game is how many cards are "drawn" before a spade.  So if you hit a spade on the 1st turn it is counted as drawing 1 card (as you don't know what the card is until AFTER you draw).  

Enjoy!  Was just my first attempt at a javascript page.
